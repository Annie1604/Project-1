# Project-1
Create three HTML pages, each with one desktop size page-scroll worth of content (full page of information). One of the pages must be your professional resume and the main page is your home page. The theme of the home page and your page 3 are your choice (for example: your favorite sport, your favorite vacation, your hobby, your future career, or information about a company you want to work for).  The three HTML pages should be named something like, index.html, resume.html, and page3.html

Requirements

NO CSS IN YOUR HTML FILE!!! This means no style at all. No spacing, no centering, no color, no italics. Just raw html.
Absolutely no br tags or use of tables for layout. This is also considered style.
Two spaces indented cascade. Each child element should be indented 2 space right of its parent.
Create a bulleted list at the top of each page. The list items will be the file names of all 3 pages. This is your basic navigation. See index.html template.
